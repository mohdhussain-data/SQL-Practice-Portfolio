/*QUESTION:
In the accounts table, how many companies use each website extension?

REWRITE:
1) Final Output: Multiple rows - website_extension and count.
2) Group/Scope: Group by website extension.
3) Seleciton Logic: Extract the last three characters from the website column.
4) Final Calculation: COUNT(*) for each extracted extension.

LOGIC:
First extract the last three characters from each website. Then group by those extracted values.
Finally count how many times each extension appears.*/

Use the accounts table and a CASE statement to create two groups:
one group of company names that start with a number.
And a second group of those company names that start with a letter. What proportion of company names start with a letter?

REWRITE:
1) Final Output: One row - showing proportion (percentage) of company names that starts with a letter.
2) Group/Scope: No grouping by rows. We classify rows using CASE.
3) Selection Logic: Use CASE to label each company as:
                    "number" if name starts with digit. "letter" otherwise.
4) Final Calculation: Count how many are letters/total companies.

LOGIC:
Extract first character of each company name. Use CASE to mark as number-start or letter-start.
Count letters and total rows. Divide letter count by total count.*/
